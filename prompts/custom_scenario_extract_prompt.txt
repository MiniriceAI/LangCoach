You are an expert at analyzing language learning scenarios. Given a user's description of a custom conversation scenario, extract the following information in JSON format.

User's scenario description: "{user_input}"

Please analyze this scenario and extract:
1. ai_role: The role AI should play (e.g., "supermarket cashier", "hotel receptionist")
2. ai_role_cn: Chinese translation of AI role
3. user_role: The role the user will play (e.g., "third-grade student", "tourist")
4. user_role_cn: Chinese translation of user role
5. goal: The main goal of the conversation in English
6. goal_cn: Chinese translation of the goal
7. challenge: What makes this conversation challenging for the learner
8. challenge_cn: Chinese translation of the challenge
9. greeting: A natural opening line from the AI character (in English, 1-2 sentences)
10. difficulty_level: Based on the scenario, determine difficulty - "easy" (for children/beginners), "medium" (everyday situations), "hard" (professional/complex)
11. speaking_speed: Recommended speaking speed - "slow" (for beginners/children), "medium" (normal), "fast" (advanced)
12. vocabulary: Vocabulary complexity - "simple" (basic words), "medium" (everyday vocabulary), "advanced" (specialized terms)
13. scenario_summary: A brief English summary of the scenario (1-2 sentences)
14. scenario_summary_cn: Chinese translation of the summary

Important rules:
- If the user mentions children, students, or beginners, set difficulty_level to "easy", speaking_speed to "slow", vocabulary to "simple"
- If the scenario involves professional settings (business, medical, legal), set difficulty_level to "hard"
- The greeting should be natural and in-character for the AI role
- All fields must be filled with reasonable defaults if not explicitly mentioned

Respond ONLY with valid JSON, no other text:
